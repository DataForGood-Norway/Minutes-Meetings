## Discussion during presentation

### DataForGood (D4G) concept

The idea of using data for projects with positive impacts isn't new. Other organiizations worldwide did it before. Somehow none exist yet in Norway besides occasional hackathons like [hack4no](https://techfugees.com/) or [techfugees](https://techfugees.com/).

D4G Norway hopes to fill this void.

Assuming we would work for NGO and Public Services might restrict ourselves.

Dirk gave the example of fish farming in Central India, where it is difficult for farmers to estimate the demand and therefore hard to plan ahead. Even though those farmers are not an NGO or a public service, we could still help them get a better margin per kg of fish and improve a lot the economic situation of this population.

By "Develop specific solution (instead of empirical research)", Peter meant to focus on applied/useful solutions, not just writing articles about them, and build apps!

Aiko would say that we do analytics that challenge/guide public discours.

Eva: How do we moderate project ideas?

Dirk described the ["Valve way"](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-24205497) where anyone can come with a project idea and each one choose a project to work on. But how to address 'committment'. He mentioned to use some kind of mechanism where each one need to help in a project before being able to offer a new project (e.g. Stackoverflow?!).

Maybe the way DataForDemocracy does it is already sufficient, as only the most popular projects get people's attention, so no need for a specific mechanism?!


Sveinung emphasized the importance of having a "problem owner", some kind of customer (e.g. a NGO or a local community), just to make sure we are solving a real problem for someone. Aiko fully agreed saying that having a problem owner with a specific problem to solve brings engagement and a sense of purpose.

Dirk: should we make a (digital) brochure showing that these people from D4G volunteered to work on these projects?

Aiko said that NGO often have limited budget, and what they might look-up is not a list of data scientist names, but rather the "mission statement",  the "non-profit" character of D4G and relevant projects which all together build trust.


So we need a website, maybe very simple, but having a clear "mission statement".

"Think:  pro-bono analytics consulting for NGOs, Public Services, ...": we don't need to focus much on the status of D4G yet, but in the future, Aiko just mentioned that there are various types of non-profit organisations to register officially D4G in Norway.

Before leaving, Aiko mentioned [HumaneTech](http://humanetech.com/) worth checking ("Inspire Humane Design", "Apply Political Pressure", "Engage Employees", ...)!

Kleng recalled the various types of structures we could get inspired from:

* hackatons (like hack4no)
* remote hackathons (like DataForDemocracy did too)
* competitions (like DataKind)
* Government tasks solved by non-gov. organisations (like Bayes Impact)

We need to take the best of all worlds!

Both the website and the Facebook account should clearly state that we are some kind of new "NGO" ready to build projects with positive impact.

One employee of Socentral also mentioned that among the 240 people working there, some might be interested using data on their own social projects (e.g .sustainable cities). They have monthly lunch, we could join one and present what we can do to help some of them.


Sveinung asked about how realistic it is to build a product given that we will work on these projects on our free time.

Dirk replied that several developers can actually do quite a lot in few days of work.

Patrick added that a lot of the other structures doing similar projects are already sharing fully operational solutions. Our tasks can be sometimes to adapt their code to our data. For example, `Bob Emploi`, the code developed by Bayes Impact to improve the matching between jobseekers and available job opportunities, could be adapted to the Norwegian job market using data provided by NAV and other open datasets.


We then tried to list the next action points:

* write clear mission statement
* get started with a proper website
* rebuild the structure on Github allowing people to post new project ideas and join a project based on the skills they have or the interests they have in the project.
* next 2 meetings in about 2 and 4 weeks, quite close from each other to get started quickly.
* The website should describe some projects:
  * Fighting poachers by tracking tweets with geolocalized pictures of endangered species like rhinos?
  * UNICEF?
  * NAV?
  * Sveinung mentioned it can also be a project started by someone else that we are trying to replicate. (e.g Biocaching, a game for naming flowers and animals/insects which in turn provides researchers with a smart way to collect data about climate change and increase/decrease of species.)


Sveinung was asked about the way hack4no managed to include very different people and profile. He said that each team was recommended to mix different skills:

* people with the original idea
* designers
* developers/data scientists
* people with business/marketing skills


Someone added we should aim quite high for our first projects.

What could that be?

* finding safe places for refugees to move and settle.
* helping rhinos by spotting tweets that would help poachers.


### Communication tools

* Slack for internal communication: [data4good-no.slack.com](https://data4good-no.slack.com)
* Facebook/Twitter for public announcements: [www.facebook.com/DataForGoodNO](https://www.facebook.com/DataForGoodNO) & [twitter.com/DataForGood_NO](https://twitter.com/DataForGood_NO)
* Github for managing projects, for supporting the decentralized part of the organisation: [github.com/dataForGood-Norway](http://github.com/dataForGood-Norway).



### Organisation of meetings and projects

* Next meetings in about 2 and 4 weeks to make quick improvements. You can already vote for meeting #2 on this [Doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/y99zmec5phvv8bks).
* No projects explicitely chosen yet! But must aim high for the first ones by all working on it.


### Next steps

* homepage: to be done within 2 weeks
* next meeting in 2 weeks: to be announced ... as soon as possible!!!
* project ideas: to be discussed on Slack very soon too.




## NEXT TASKS

> Please write new tasks and assign yourself or others to it!
> To do so, simply write issues to this repository and add labels to it!

If it is not clear, and it won't be if you are new to Github, please contact me patrick.merlot@gmail.com or ask for help on [Slack](https://data4good-no.slack.com).
